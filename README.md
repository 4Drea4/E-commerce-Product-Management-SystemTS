# Ecommerce Platform
## Andrea E! *Friday November 21<sup>st</sup> 2025*

### Index


#### Technology Used
Using HTML,CSS, Javascript/ Typescript and an external API, I built an E-Commerce Platform. This application has proper error handling for product fetching. Utilizing my understanding of class based Object Oriented Programming (Instances, Classes, Methods)
#### Reflection

###### Difficulties: 
 -The first mistake I originally made was beginning without proper planning. I set up my project files and I sorted through the project scope and generalized what I would have done. I quickly realized before getting into the project to deeply I needed a more thorough plan especially when it came to working on the platform over the span of a few days. This shift allowed me to create an organized and thorough plan of completion. In a real world example this would be also beneficial if I were to be working on a team, because this means anyone could pick up on a piece of work and it have a better streamline of completion. 

*How you implemented TypeScript features and OOP principles.*
- I implemented typescript and it made understanding my project that much easier. It helps set expectations of input and outputs. Utilizing object oriented programming helped me store product data, transform raw data, and do things like calculate prices / discounts.

-The challenges you encountered and how you overcame them.
-How you handled asynchronous operations and error management.
